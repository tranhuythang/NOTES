http://tony.coadou.fr/2017/05/09/install-cisco-anyconnect-and-pfx-certificate-on-kali-linux-64/

2. Mainframe emulator:
Run AnnyConnect first and log in the VPN

    username: uhi\1299645
    password:
Install PASSPORT WEB TO HOST for Internet Explorer
If the process print an error, ignore it and use the shortcut mainframe.lnk

3. JDK 8: https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot
(note Adopt is similar to Oracle Open JDK. Use ziped package instead of MSI)

4. Eclipse 2020-06 J2E to use only JDK 8 otherwise IBM zOS explorer will not work

To remove installed Eclipse: Delete .p2, .eclipse, .tooling folders in users/name
You can install Eclipse by an installer or by a Non-install package (portable)
In the case of non-install pacakge: unzip the package, modify eclipse.ini by adding the following 2 lines to before -vmargs (note -- means comment)
-vm
Path\to\JDK\bin\javaw.exe

5. TFS
-  Install TFS plug in
Have token for TFS at: https://dev.azure.com/uhaul/_usersSettings/tokens
token: bnbk26sxwdi27l4gsvn5n6gbprvftaad4ef4h4x565wo64qce32a - 30 12 2021

For TFS that works with Java 11: Download the zip file for TFS and then install from the zip file INSTEAD OF from a repository.
For OLD TFS that doesn't work with Jav 11: http://dl.microsoft.com/eclipse/tfs

-  Import Uhaul's TFS OPERATION repos 
Double check if TFS repository is mapped to the previous Eclipse working space. If so, remove the mapping.
Even when you don't see an existing mapping, you still have to double check where Uhaul repos is imported TO; otherwise they will saved in an old Eclipse TFS. 

-  Set up dependency 
  datacom_developement, datasources_development
  - If have more than 2 projects, be careful with circular dependencies. 
  - Note that use EXTERNAL JARS instead of creating a Libarary otherwise exporting is not working. 
  - If has any problem with jar files, just remove and then re-add them

"Error: Could not find or load main class" -- cannot find the compiled bytecode .class file. 
This is because the program OR a class that the program calls has error and doesn't compile.

If you don't see any error in your program, but still Pay attention to "PROBLEMS" tab (often close to Console tab).
